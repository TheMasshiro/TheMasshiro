## Hi there 👋 I'm John Christian Vicente

# 💫 About Me:
As a student at President Ramon Magsaysay State University studying computer engineering, I strongly desire to learn more about the broad and fascinating field. I'm always trying to learn, develop, and satisfy my curiosity in everything from hardware to software because there's always something new to find in this field that's always changing!
